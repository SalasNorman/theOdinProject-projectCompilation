# Stock Picker

A simple Ruby implementation of an algorithm to find the best days to buy and sell stocks for maximum profit.

## Description

The stock picker algorithm analyzes an array of stock prices over time and determines the optimal days to buy and sell a stock to maximize profit. This project provides a Ruby script that implements this logic, assuming you can only make one buy and one sell transaction.

## Features

- Analyzes an array of stock prices to find maximum profit
- Identifies the best buy and sell days
- Handles arrays of varying lengths and price values
- Provides clear output showing the profit calculation

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.0 or higher)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `stock_picker` directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ruby stock_picker.rb
   ```

The script includes built-in examples that will print the maximum profit and the corresponding buy/sell prices.

## Live Demo

## Examples

```ruby
stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
# Output: "for a profit of $15 - $3 = $12"
```
