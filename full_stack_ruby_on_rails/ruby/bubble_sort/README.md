# Bubble Sort

A simple Ruby implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

## Description

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. This project provides a Ruby script to sort arrays using this method.

## Features

- Sorts arrays of integers in ascending order
- Modifies the array in place
- Simple and easy to understand implementation

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.0 or higher)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `bubble_sort` directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ruby bubble_sort.rb
   ```

The script includes built-in examples that will print sorted outputs.

## Live Demo

Try the Bubble Sort online: [Paiza.io Demo](https://paiza.io/projects/BxuQUFcOvlWVf082f7TZEw)

## Examples

```ruby
bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
# Output: [0,2,2,3,4,78]

bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
# Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
